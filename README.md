# Emo-Room-Design

A fun and creative AI project that generates photorealistic bedroom designs based on a person's **emotion**, **age**, and **gender**. It uses **text-to-image generation** (via Stable Diffusion) to visualize interior spaces that match the user's current emotional state and personality.

## How it works

- Users input their **emotion**, **age**, and **gender**
- The system generates a descriptive room design prompt
- A Stable Diffusion model turns the prompt into a realistic bedroom image
- The image is saved with a meaningful filename
